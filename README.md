> *By Lyra* | Designed for practitioners, researchers, and finance students

##  Overview

This toolkit provides a **comprehensive, modular framework** for modeling and forecasting financial volatility using **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)** models. Built with flexibility and reusability in mind, it supports multiple data sources and offers complete end-to-end volatility analysis workflow.

### Why GARCH?

GARCH models are the industry standard for financial volatility modeling because they:
- **Capture volatility clustering** ‚Äî periods of high volatility tend to follow high volatility
- **Model persistence** ‚Äî understand how long volatility shocks last in the market
- **Enable risk management** ‚Äî provide time-varying volatility estimates for VaR and portfolio optimization
- **Support derivatives pricing** ‚Äî essential for options and other volatility-dependent instruments

### Key Applications

- **Risk Management**: Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation and portfolio risk assessment
- **Trading Strategies**: Volatility-based position sizing and risk-adjusted returns
- **Derivatives Pricing**: Volatility forecasts for options and structured products
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding volatility regimes and market stress periods

##  Quick Start

### Example: Analyzing Apple Stock Volatility

```python
SYMBOL = "AAPL"
START = "2020-01-01"
END = "2024-01-01"
DATA_SOURCE = "yfinance"
MEAN_MODEL = "Constant"
VOL_MODEL = "GARCH"
P, Q = 1, 1
DIST = "normal"
FORECAST_STEPS = 30
```

Run the notebook to get:
- Apple's historical conditional volatility
- 30-day ahead volatility forecast
- Model diagnostics and residual analysis

##  Usage Examples

### Example 1: S&P 500 Volatility Analysis

```python
# Configure for S&P 500
SYMBOL = "^GSPC"
START = "2015-01-01"
END = "2024-01-01"
DATA_SOURCE = "yfinance"
MEAN_MODEL = "Constant"
VOL_MODEL = "GARCH"
P, Q = 1, 1
DIST = "t"  # Student's t for fat tails
FORECAST_STEPS = 20
```

### Example 2: Chinese Stock Market (TuShare)

```python
# Configure for Shanghai Stock Exchange
SYMBOL = "600036.SH"  # China Merchants Bank
START = "2018-01-01"
END = "2024-01-01"
DATA_SOURCE = "tushare"  # Requires TUSHARE_TOKEN in .env
MEAN_MODEL = "AR(1)"
VOL_MODEL = "GARCH"
P, Q = 1, 1
DIST = "normal"
FORECAST_STEPS = 30
```

### Example 3: Custom CSV Data

```python
# Prepare your CSV with columns: datetime, close
# Example format:
# datetime,close
# 2020-01-01,100.5
# 2020-01-02,101.2
# ...

CSV_PATH = "your_data.csv"
DATA_SOURCE = "csv"
MEAN_MODEL = "Constant"
VOL_MODEL = "GARCH"
P, Q = 1, 1
DIST = "normal"
FORECAST_STEPS = 20
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `ImportError: No module named 'yfinance'`  
**Solution**: Install missing package: `pip install yfinance`

**Issue**: `ValueError: yfinance returned no data`  
**Solution**: Check symbol format (e.g., use `^GSPC` for S&P 500, `.SS` for Shanghai)

**Issue**: `TuShare Token Error`  
**Solution**: Ensure `.env` file exists with correct `TUSHARE_TOKEN=your_token`

**Issue**: `CSV must contain datetime/close columns`  
**Solution**: Ensure your CSV has columns named `datetime` (or `date`, `Date`) and `close` (or `Close`, `Adj Close`)

##  Personal Note

GARCH modeling is powerful for understanding **volatility clustering and risk regimes** in financial markets. This toolkit prioritizes **reusability** and **standardization**: unified data interfaces, fixed modeling steps, and consistent outputs. In real investment research, I adjust distributions and model orders based on residual diagnostics to better match asset characteristics. The goal is to make volatility analysis accessible while maintaining professional standards.
